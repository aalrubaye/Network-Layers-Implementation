# Network-Layers-Implementation

##Instructions
- The program is written using JAVA.
- Has two classes: 
    * One is (Main class): which includes the threads
  	* Second is (Node) which is the implementation of layer's 2,3,4 functionality in each node (thread)
- There is a text file (data.txt) which has to be send to the receiver
- Run the program 
- Enter the IP or the host name of the sender and the receiver
- The output will be easy enough to understand:
  * The Ethernet frames for each sending operation, consisting of all fields (even the TCP/IP header) except the payload.
- At the end, you will see another text file which its name is the same as the receiver address
  * This means that the data has been sent correctly to the destination.
  
  ##The output:
